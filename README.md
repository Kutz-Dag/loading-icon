# The loading-icon
An innovative way of showing a loading button when waiting for a website to load.
Here is an example:

![loading-icon-image](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2015/02/22/17/56/loading-645268_1280.jpg)

### I used these languages to create this project:
```html
<div>
  <p>HTML</p>
  <p>CSS</p>
  <p>SASS</p>
</div>
```

> I mainly used Cascading StyleSheets (CSS) for this repo.

### What was the aim?
* To make the loading icon (the one that pops up while waiting for a website to load or when a video is buffering)
* To make it appear more modern
* To animate it using CSS

## Here is the result:
